## Welcome to Nawal's Info

Hai! My name is Nawal and this website will have a combination of things that I personally like or stuff in general that I want to talk about. I am 15 years old(as of June, 2017) and I am a sophomore at [Acadmey for Software Engineering](https://www.afsenyc.org/). That was a link to my schools website, were just starting out and were an average school however we teach computer science which makes us special and pretty cool. 

My life is pretty simple. I'm an average girl who goes to a special school full of bullies, ideaologist and dreamers. However, school is a bit like society in that we have a social class where people fall in but slowly were mixing and its pretty cool. Sadly, like every other school we have bullies and boys who think its fun to do disgusting and dirty things. 

School Lunch

```markdown
School lunch- let me rephrase that, highschool lunch has not changed from middle school lunch. Its stil the most dirty, weird, disgusting, depressing food that was ever creating on the planet. Yet, students still want to eat this and it scares me sometimes.

- Todays Lunch

1. **FAKE** cheese steak on a New York Hero
2. **BROWN LOOKING** cold bean salad
3. (only good thing on menu)New York Apple Slices

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### My Honesty Poem
```markdown
**I was born** in the fall but I like to say summer because that’s the season I wish i was born in even though I get cold easily
**I hear that** disaster struck 3 days after I was born when the twin towers fell, right after I left the hospital and my mother thanks god nothing happened to us
**I am** 5’5 tall and that’s something I’m insecure about
**I like** meat, yes I’m very vague
**I don’t know** how to speak  clearly, so sometimes I stutter
**But I love** to play music, it’s my way of getting people to understand the real me
**I am** still learning how to live and communicate which I know I failing at
**Sometimes I can** be outspoken when I want to be quiet because words mean a lot to people
**I like** dedicating my time to my academics and family. That’s why maybe I’m bad at communicating and being a friend or making new friends. 
**I’ve never** been Skydiving
**But I** heard it’s a life changing experience 
**I am** Dedicated, Talented, and hardworking yet I can’t seem to do anything right.
**I know** I can still work on my behavior, my actions and my socializing
**But** I am proud of myself most for what I’ve made of my life so far and who I’ve become as a person today.
**I love** my family and friends.
**I am** neither rich nor poor and I have all I need to get by yet I always want more than I have. 
**I** never know exactly what I want but I know what I need and what I don’t. 
**I speak** too much when I should be choosing my words more wisely and some days when I think I’m standing tall I eventually trip and fall down. 
**I am** competitive and I cry when I don’t understand things all the time. 
**I am** going to chase my dreams and get everything I’ve always wanted one day not because I’ve worked hard in life but because I have faith.
**But** I don’t believe in fairy tales yet deep down I’m a little girl with small problems who over exaggerates. 
**My shadow is someone worth following** because I don’t know what I want in life but then again who knows what they want in life. I am working towards a goal and as long as I keep my head up and know which path to take I am worth following because that’s all I can give you, some advice. And sometimes that’s all you never in life.
